A little about this website. Under the projects tab in the masthead, you can find more information on some of the previous projects I have worked on. Under resume, there is an up to date version of my resume, as well as a link to download a copy. Please feel free to contact me via email using the 'Email Me' tab, or connect with me on LinkedIn.
